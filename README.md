## Mapping tools

#### [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/)

A tool to map bisulfite converted sequence reads and determine cytosine methylation states

## DMR detection tools


#### [HOME (histogram of methylation)](https://github.com/ListerLab/HOME)

HOME (histogram of methylation) is a python package for differential methylation region (DMR) identification. The method uses histogram of methylation features and the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify DMRs from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. HOME can identify both pairwise and time series DMRs with or without replicates. #Installation HOME is written for python 2.7 and tested on Linux system. It is recommended to set up virtual environment for python 2.7 first before installing HOME package.


## Visualization tools

### [ViewBS](https://github.com/xie186/ViewBS)

ViewBS - Tools for exploring and visualizing bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) data. 

### [BSviewer](http://sunlab.cpy.cuhk.edu.hk/BSviewer/)

BSviewer: a genotype-preserving, nucleotide-level visualizer for bisulfite sequencing data
